        sisgw "Is that so?"
        "Sister Gwen did not seem to believe him. She spoke as though entertaining a child's story. Did she really see no threat here? He had to make her understand somehow."
        ro "I worry for the villages here, Sister Gwen. I pray they do not get taken in by the creatures wandering these woods."
        "Her laughter was not something Rowan had expected."
        sisgw "You mean to pull my leg. Just because you are a hero does not mean I will fall for these gags. We all know such problems were taken care of long ago."
        sisgw "Karnas is dead. There wonâ€™t be another demon war for a lifetime."
        "She dismissed his warning with a wave of her slim hand. Rowan could not help but realize just how small Sister Gwen was: naively brave and new to the world." 
        "She had likely spent much of her life up until this point in a convent, sheltered from the travesties that unravelled throughout Rosaria." 
        ro "I am not joking, sister."
        "Sister Gwen raised an eyebrow, but after seeing the grave look on his face, he noticed how her body stiffened and she seemed to actually take a glance at her surroundings, searching between the trees and across the plains for one of the horrendous beasts her church spoke of."
        sisgw "You believe in these rumors then, Rowan?"
        ro "I believe that times are changing, sister, and there are more things that stalk the land than just wild animals."
        "Sister Gwen drew silent, and the sun dipped lower over the horizon, stretching the shadows of the nearby forest across the fields like clawed hands. There was a chill in the air, a foreboding that could not be ignored."
        sisgw "Could you say you have seen this firsthand, Rowan? The demonic activity?"
        "Her gaze was searching, and he knew she was putting her trust in him as a hero to tell the truth. While she kept her expression indifferent, Rowan noticed how her hands were clenched tightly in front of her and that she stepped a little quicker down the road."
        ro "...Yes. I have."
        "The nun's lips pressed together in a tight line. She did not want to believe in it, but hearing it come from a man who had fought these very creatures firsthand, it was hard to ignore."
        ro "You should be careful, Sister Gwen. These monsters are nothing to take lightly, and if you do, they will have you in their trap before you realize it."
        "The weight of the amulet suddenly felt very heavy around Rowan's neck, but he tried not to draw attention to it. Sister Gwen's face paled and she nodded, her body moving a little closer to Rowan as they continued their journey to town."
        sisgw "...I see."
        "Although she did not make any such promises, Rowan felt that he had gotten through to her, and that was enough."
        "They reached the outskirts of a local village shortly after, and Rowan bid the nun farewell. There wasn't much in his power he could do, but every little warning counted."

"The nun's air of haughtiness and superiority rubbed Rowan the wrong way. He had seen firsthand what these monsters could do, and somehow this woman thought she was above it all; immune to the effects of every other village around her."
"A little further down the road, an idea popped into his mind, and Rowan knew precisely how to make Sister Gwen take the threat seriously."

ro "It's getting dark; we should set up camp for the night."
         
"Sister Gwen raised a brow and glanced back down the road."

sisgw "We are not that far off from the village. Surely we can reach it if we pick up the pace."

sisgw "No doubt, youâ€™re the expert. Very well. Allow us to rest for the night; I'm sure the demons can wait another night."

"She smirked at her own joke and helped Rowan set up camp, handling the meal prep while Rowan fetched wood and established a fire."
"When he was a little ways off from their campsite, one arm full of sticks and broken logs, Rowan spoke into his amulet."

ro "Jezera?"

je "Yes? Is there a problem?"

"Although usually somewhat patient with him, Rowan briefly wondered if he had interrupted something. From the small moans he heard in the background, he was certain the answer was yes."

ro "I need you to send me an incubus. Tell him to go along with what I say."

je "An incubus? Really, Rowan, if you needed sex, I'm sure you could--"

ro "It's not for me, Jezera. Can you send him or not?"

je "Very well. It should take him a few hours to get to you from the portal. I'm curious about what you plan to do to him, though, so I'll have him relay everything when he returns."

"He didn't really care what Jezera did with the incubus afterwards, as long as he followed Rowan's lead."
"After a few hours, the sun dipped low over the horizon, basking the fields in twilight, and the fire was raging high. Rowan dumped the rest of the sticks and logs into the center while Sister Gwen served up some sandwiches she made in his absence."

ro "So, what made you decide to go into the convent, sister?"

sisgw "Oh, following the Goddess's words were always my calling. When I was a child, I-- A-Aaaahhh!!"

"Sister Gwen let out a shriek as an incubus appeared beside the fire in a grand display of fog and smoke, as though he were stepping out of thin air. Rowan was careful not to look at the incubus, keeping his gaze focused on Sister Gwen."

ro "What is it, sister? Are you alright?"

"Rowan glanced back at the smirking incubus, then further across the plains around him, pretending to see nothing."

ro "What is it?"

"Sister Gwen gaped at him, just as quickly diverting her gaze back to the incubus standing proudly beside the fire. The incubus's hips swayed as he walked closer to the nun. She scooted away."

sisgw "Don't you see him?! You must! He's right there!"

"She thrust a hand out towards the incubus, who quickly snatched her palm and gave her finger a little suckle. She yanked her hand away and clutched it to her chest, her face blossoming in a bright red."
"Rowan tried not to laugh or even smile. It was no easy task, especially considering how flustered the nun was."

ro "I don't see anything, Sister. There's nothing there."

"The incubus' eyes sparkled as he picked up on Rowan's intentions. There was little keeping him clothed in the first place, but the demon removed the thin cloth wrapped around his waist, dropping it into a pile beside the campfire."

ro "What are you seeing, Sister?"

"Sister Gwen stammered out a response, desperately working to shield her eyes from the disrobing demon, but he was difficult to ignore."

sisgw "A-A-Anâ€¦ I-Incubusâ€¦"

"She could barely get the word out, the pallor of her skin turning an even brighter red as she caught a glimpse of the incubus removing his pants. Rowan looked in the same direction as her, toward the incubus, but played dubious."

ro "An incubus? I don't see anything, sister."

"The lustful demon wrapped a strong hand around his cock and pumped, earning another frightened squeak of the nun. She did not glance away this time, however; her gaze was frozen on the steady movements of the incubus as he pleasured himself right beside her."

sisgw "B-But it's right the--"

ro "Are you sure you see it? You aren't havingâ€¦ impure thoughts, are you, sister?"

"Rowan cocked his head to the side and looked at her politely, but inside he was laughing away, enjoying the sight of the nun squirming uncomfortably on the ground."
"This was what she deserved, after all, for insisting there was no danger here."

sisgw "N-No, of course notâ€¦ Forgive me, I must have been mistaken."

"But she looked at the incubus deadon, her youthful curiosity getting the better of her as she watched the incubus dance around her, his cock growing with each flick of the wrist. His one visible eye roamed across her body, seeming to pierce through each layer of her dress."
"Something changed in the nun's expression, and Rowan saw her haughtiness subside into a natural desire as her eyes traced every sway of the demon's hips, the broad expanse of his chest, and the hard erection poking out from his crotch."
"It was likely she had never seen an exposed man before, and even more likely that she never felt the desire of one pressed against her body." 
"Rowan stood up, and while the incubus spy did not falter in his self pleasure, Sister Gwen jumped, certainly haven forgotten that the Hero of Karst was even there. She looked away in shame."

ro "Well, since you're so worried, I'll go make sure there are no demons in the area."

sisgw "W-What? No, you needn't do thatâ€¦"

"She reached out to stop him, but her fingers paused in the air. Rowan could see she was afraid, but it was not what the incubus would do if she was left alone with him that scared her; it was what she might do."

ro "({i}Perhaps she shouldn't have such impure thoughts{/i}.)"

#ro smirk
"Rowan smirked."

"Oh, don't worry. I won't be gone long. I think it will give us both some peace of mind."

"Just out of sight behind the forest foliage, Rowan leaned against the bark of a tree and watched with a mischievous gaze."

traz "Sister, huh? A little nun~ Now that's just too cute. My name is Trazear. Remember that when you're screaming with pleasure."

"He winked at her. Despite the sweetness in his tone, the incubus's voice was husky as he bent down to her eye level." 
"Rowan chuckled as the nun had trouble keeping eye contact with the incubus as he continued the steady movements on his cock. "

traz "Don't be so shy. Here, you can touch it."

"Sister Gwen let out a small gasp as the incubus took her hands and wrapped it around his cock. She sat still, her body unmoving."

sisgw "You're not realâ€¦ Y-You're just a figment of my imaginationâ€¦"

traz "Oh, then you must have a pretty dirty imagination."

"She flushed to the tips of her ears and looked away, but she did not remove her hands."

traz " Here~ It must be your first time. Let me help you."

"The incubus knelt down in front of her and placed his hands over hers, moving them up and down his shaft." 
"Sister Gwen tried to avert her gaze, but soon she could not resist her own curiosity and she stared in amazement as Trazear's cock twitched and throbbed beneath her palms. "
"Rowan had to bite back an audible laugh as he watched the nun's curiosity take hold of her. It was too easy for her to drop decorum and give in to her base instincts."
"After a few moments, the incubus released his hold on her hands and moved them to her thighs, pushing the fabric of her dress up as she worked on him by herself. She didn't even seem to notice him removing her dress, her focus solely on the smooth curve of his shaft."

traz "Is it what you thought it would be?"

sisgw "I-Itâ€¦ It's smooth."

traz "Why don't you taste it?"

"Sister Gwen lowered her head and timidly licked the slit of his tip. Trazear stroked her hair with one hand while the other pinched and pulled at her nipples, giving each one an equal amount of attention in turn."

traz "Oh, aren't you lovely."

"The compliment urged her on, and Sister Gwen opened her mouth, allowing the tip to move past her lips." 
"There was no doubt she was inexperienced, but Trazear was patient and allowed her to explore different techniques on his cock, thrusting deeper inside of her mouth with each pleasant touch until she was gagging."
"Trazear pulled out of her mouth, earning a disappointed whimper from the nun. He smirked down at her and nudged her down onto her back."

"Rowan could see the embarrassment on her face as Trazear forced her legs apart and settled between her gaping thighs. "

traz "My oh my~ Is this all for me? What a {i}dirty{/i} little nun."

"Trazear ran a finger along her slit and pressed it into his mouth, licking the juices clean off. Her body shuddered, her hips involuntarily jerking toward him."

traz "Simply delightful."

"Wasting no more time, the incubus shoved himself fully into her at once, earning a pained cry from the nun."

traz "Oh right! You're a virgin. I should have taken that slowly, right?"

"Trazear thrusted in and out of her with a little more care, and with each movement, the pain inside of Sister Gwen seemed to ease into a needy pleasure instead."
"Rowan didn't expect Sister Gwen to know what to do, but it seemed Trazear was happy to take on a more dominant role as he fucked the nun's open cunt, each thrust and clench of her pussy pushing them close to the edge. "
"Sister Gwen dug her nails into the ground and hooked her legs around his waist as Trazear grabbed her breasts for leverage. Rowan grinned at the sight of her bouncing chest as Trazear rocked her body against the ground. "
"Her soft moans turned into cries, and she seemed no longer able to contain herself as he pounded into her body harder--"
"Harder--"
"Harder--"

"Her back arched toward him as she met her climax, her body convulsing uncontrollably as Trazear continued to fuck her senseless."

je "Oh, no trouble at all. He's already back, and he's brought that pleasant little girl for me to play with."

"She'd left already?"
"Now that he listened carefully, Rowan realized he could no longer hear the nun's cries of pleasure. He peeked through the foliage, surprised to see the two of them gone."
"Mistaking his silence, Jezera hurried to reassure him."

je "Don't worry, I didn't kidnap her; she agreed to come to the castle willingly. And let me tell you, we're having a {i}splendid{/i} time, aren't we, sister~?"
